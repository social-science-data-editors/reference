WRDS does allow for sharing of data with data editors for "audit" purposes. Their guidelines are at <https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/support-articles/coauthor-publishing/navigating-co-authorship-across-institutions-a-guide-to-data-sharing-and-compliance/> (login required for that page!). An excerpt (as of 2025-11-11):


> **When Submitting Your Paper for Publication**
>
> Once your research paper is complete and you move toward publication:
>
> 1. Follow the Publisher Submission and Audit Requirements
>
> - Many journals require that your paper be audited for accuracy before publication.
> - During the audit process, you may be asked to submit raw data directly to the journal or its audit partner.
>
> 2. Ensure Data is Handled Properly
>
> - The submitted raw data must be used only for audit purposes.
> - The auditing party typically agrees in writing that the data will be:
>   - Used solely for verification of your published results
>   - Not retained, reused, or redistributed
>   - Expunged or deleted once the audit process is complete.
>
> Always verify that the auditing body agrees to these terms in writing, and retain that confirmation for your records.
